                <h3>The Project</h3>
                <p>Learning about GLSL I learnt how to make a kaleidoscope. One of the parts I found most entertaining learning GLSL was playing with different variables and seeing how to images would change. Therefor, I wanted to create my own kaleidoscope generator.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>The Result</h3>
                <p>The result was a very interactive kaleidoscope that you can change to your own liking. I also uploaded many pictures to base the kaleidoscope on.</p>
                <p>Potential improvements I would like to make is being able to upload your own pictures and making the generator less intense on the GPU.</p>

                <h3>Obstacles</h3>
                <p>During the project I decided to use React as well as TypeScript which is something I had never done before.</p>
                <p>Furthermore the library I was using didnâ€™t have TypeScript support and I had to use another version of it. However, this version was configured to use the wrong files in their package.json. I fixed the issue and let the author know about the bug.</p>
